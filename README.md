## 🚀 Overview

Agentic Omnichannel Retail CoPilot is an AI-driven Sales Agent that delivers a continuous, unified retail experience across mobile apps, websites, WhatsApp, and in-store kiosks. Built with LangGraph, Groq-accelerated Llama 3, and modular Worker Agents, it handles product discovery, real-time inventory checks, loyalty offers, payments, fulfilment, QR-based in-store reservations, and post-purchase support — all within a single shared session.

The system manages edge cases intelligently, including stock issues and failed card payments, by triggering automatic UPI/COD fallback. The prototype demonstrates a seamless end-to-end journey: search online → reserve via QR → continue in-store → complete purchase → recover from payment failure → receive WhatsApp confirmation. Every step continues the same conversation with zero repeated inputs.

Built with a modular multi-agent architecture, the CoPilot is scalable, extensible, and ready to integrate real retail APIs (inventory, loyalty, WhatsApp/Twilio, payments). It delivers a guided, proactive, and resilient omnichannel experience; reducing abandonment, improving conversions, and elevating customer satisfaction across both digital and physical retail.
