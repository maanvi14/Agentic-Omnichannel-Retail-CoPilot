## 🚀 Overview

Agentic Omnichannel Retail CoPilot is an AI-driven Sales Agent that delivers a continuous, unified retail experience across mobile apps, websites, WhatsApp, and in-store kiosks.Built with LangGraph, Groq-accelerated Llama 3, and modular Worker Agents, it handles product discovery, real-time inventory checks, loyalty offers, payments, fulfilment, and QR-based in-store reservations,and post-purchase support, all within a single shared session.The system also handles edge cases intelligently, such as stock issues or failed card payments, by triggering automatic UPI/COD fallback.The prototype demonstrates a seamless end-to-end journey: search online → reserve via QR → continue in-store → complete purchase → payment failure recovery → receive WhatsApp confirmation.Every step continues the same conversation with zero repeated inputs.

Built with a modular multi-agent architecture, the CoPilot is scalable, extensible, and ready to integrate real retail APIs (inventory, loyalty, WhatsApp/Twilio, payments). It delivers a guided, proactive, and resilient omnichannel experience — reducing abandonment, improving conversions, and elevating customer satisfaction across digital and physical retail.
